Give any AI coding agent expert, **workflow-driven** knowledge of the [Paymob](https://paymob.com) payment gateway across **Egypt, UAE, KSA, and Oman**. The agent routes the developer by platform, walks through onboarding, and produces correct, copy-ready code for accepting cards, mobile wallets, BNPLs, Apple Pay, Google Pay, kiosk, and bank installments — on any tech stack.

Ships as a Claude Code / Cowork plugin **and** as a portable prompt (`universal-prompt.md`) + `AGENTS.md` so it works in Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and more.

## Works with any AI agent

It's all plain Markdown — any AI assistant can use it. Find your tool below; most setups take a single step.

### 1. Coding agents → drop in `AGENTS.md` (easiest, recommended)

[`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md) is an open standard that coding agents read **automatically** from your project's root folder. Natively supported by **OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Aider, Zed, Jules, Devin, Factory, Amp, RooCode, Warp, JetBrains Junie**, and more.

**One step** — copy this repo's [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) into the root of *your* project:

```bash
# run this from your project's root folder
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaymobAccept/Paymob-AI-Integration-Skill/main/AGENTS.md
```

- Already have an `AGENTS.md`? Just paste this one's contents into it under a `## Paymob` heading.
- Now ask your agent in plain English — *"Add Paymob card payments to my checkout"* — and it follows the Paymob rules automatically.

### 2. Chat assistants (ChatGPT · Gemini · Claude.ai · Copilot Chat …) → paste `universal-prompt.md`

1. Open [`universal-prompt.md`](universal-prompt.md) and **copy the whole file**.
2. Paste it into the assistant's **system prompt** / **custom instructions** (ChatGPT: *Settings → Personalization → Custom instructions*; Gemini: a *Gem*; Claude.ai: a *Project*'s instructions).
3. Describe what you're building. It's fully self-contained — no other files needed.

### 3. Prefer a pinned editor rules file? (optional)

If you'd rather use your editor's native rules file instead of `AGENTS.md`, save [`universal-prompt.md`](universal-prompt.md) as:

| Tool | Save it as (in your project) |
|---|---|
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/paymob.mdc` |
| Windsurf / Devin Desktop | `.windsurf/rules/paymob.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Cline · Continue · Roo | the tool's rules / context file |

### 4. Claude Code / Cowork → install the full plugin

One command installs the complete workflow **and** auto-registers the bundled live Paymob MCP server (see [below](#live-access--paymob-mcp-server)):

```bash
claude plugin install --git https://github.com/PaymobAccept/Paymob-AI-Integration-Skill
```

Cowork and local-dev options are under [Installation](#installation).

> **One source of truth, no drift:** the full skill lives in `skills/paymob-integration/`; `universal-prompt.md` is its self-contained portable copy; `AGENTS.md` is a short router to it.

---

## What it does

When you ask the agent for help integrating Paymob, it provides:

- **Platform routing first** — detects Shopify, an official e-commerce plugin platform (WooCommerce, Magento, Odoo, OpenCart, PrestaShop, …), or a custom build, and steers you to the fastest correct path instead of hand-coding when a prebuilt integration already exists.
- **Guided onboarding** — merchant-status check, dashboard credential collection, and sandbox-first testing before go-live.
- **Complete Intention API knowledge** — the only official payment-creation flow, with Unified Checkout (redirect) and the Pixel SDK (embedded).
- **Native Mobile SDK flow** — iOS / Android / Flutter / React Native, keeping the Secret Key off the device.
- **Corrected, copy-ready code in your stack** — Node.js/TypeScript/NestJS, Python/Django/Flask/FastAPI, PHP/Laravel, .NET/C#, Ruby/Rails, and React/Next.js/Vue.
- **All 3 HMAC types** — transaction, card token, and subscription — with exact field orders, SHA-512, and timing-safe comparison.
- **Reconciliation** — a Transaction Inquiry fallback for callbacks that never arrive, stuck "pending" orders, and admin lookups.
- **Core & advanced features** — subscriptions, saved cards (CIT/MIT), Auth/Capture, refund/void, split features, convenience fees.
- **Live-doc discipline** — points at Paymob's `llms.txt` index, developer docs, Integration Wizard, and community forum so the agent can confirm anything that may have changed.

## Live access — Paymob MCP server

Beyond *generating* code, agents can act on a merchant's **real Paymob account** through Paymob's official [MCP server](https://mcp.paymob.com/mcp) — creating payment intentions and links, pulling transactions/balances, exporting reports, requesting settlements, and opening support tickets (~25 tools). Great for interactive testing and reconciliation.

This plugin **bundles** it: the repo ships a root [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json), so enabling the plugin registers the `paymob` server automatically. To add it to any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paymob": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.paymob.com/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Or in Claude Code standalone:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http paymob https://mcp.paymob.com/mcp
```

You authenticate **in-session** with your own Paymob API credentials (test mode first — it includes money-movement tools). It complements, but does **not** replace, the HMAC-verified webhook as the source of truth. Full setup, the tool catalog, and security notes: [`references/mcp-server.md`](skills/paymob-integration/references/mcp-server.md).

## Installation

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude plugin install --git https://github.com/PaymobAccept/Paymob-AI-Integration-Skill
```

### Cowork (Desktop)

Install from the plugin marketplace, or point to this repo as a custom marketplace source.

### Other agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Codex, …)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaymobAccept/Paymob-AI-Integration-Skill.git
```

Then follow the [Works with any AI agent](#works-with-any-ai-agent) table — copy `AGENTS.md` or `universal-prompt.md` into your own project at the location your tool expects.

### Local development (Claude Code)

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./Paymob-AI-Integration-Skill
```

---

## Usage

Once installed, the agent activates on any Paymob request — or even a generic regional payment request ("add a payment gateway to my UAE store"). Try prompts like:

- "Help me integrate Paymob card payments in my Next.js app"
- "Add Vodafone Cash wallet payments to my Laravel backend"
- "My Paymob HMAC validation keeps failing — here's my code..."
- "Set up Paymob subscriptions with Python/FastAPI"
- "Integrate Apple Pay with Paymob in my React Native app"
- "Reconcile a Paymob order that's stuck pending"
- "Add Paymob to my Shopify / WooCommerce store"

## Security

- Only the **Public Key** (`pk_*`) is safe in frontend code. The **Secret Key**, **API Key**, and **HMAC Secret** are server-side only — never commit them or ship them in a mobile binary.
- **The HMAC-verified webhook callback is the source of truth** for payment status — never the browser redirect params or a mobile SDK result.
- Always verify HMAC with **SHA-512** and a timing-safe comparison, and process callbacks **idempotently** (key on `order.id` / `special_reference`).

## Staying current

Specs embedded here are known-good as of **June 2026**. Paymob changes endpoints, field orders, and SDK versions on its own schedule — the skill instructs the agent to cross-check the live docs ([`references/live-resources.md`](skills/paymob-integration/references/live-resources.md), especially the machine-readable `llms.txt` index) and lets the live docs win on any disagreement.
